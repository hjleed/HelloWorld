# Hello World
Computers only do what they’re told. How do you tell a computer what to do? You use a programming language.
The very first thing you’ll do when learning a new programming language is how to make the computer display “Hello, World”.

There is no perfect programming language, they all offer something a little different, and there are hundreds of programming languages
with new ones being created every day.

Here is a selection of the most popular programming languages that have a place in the programming hall of fame.

##BASH (UNIX SHELL)
Used to interact with and manage Linux and Unix system at the command line.

##C
The most important language in the world. It’s what operating systems like Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android are written in, 
as well as browsers and 3D games engines. Its syntax has influenced countless other programming languages.

##C++
Has performance close to C and is used in many important projects like the Chrome Browser. 
C++ was an effort to make a language that was easier to build large projects with while still being fast and efficient.

##FORTRAN
Created in the 1950s to run on mainframe computers, it’s well suited for numerical and scientific work.
It became standard in the scientific world where it’s still used today.

##JAVA
Something that made Java special is that it was designed so you could write code once and then allow it to run on any operation system. Java is the most popular programming language in the world.
It’s used to teach students and in large companies. All Android apps are written in Java.

##MATLAB
A combination of a programme and a language. Used to analyse data and develop algorithms. It’s used in education to teach linear algebra and numerical analysis.
It’s also popular with scientists doing work with image manipulation.

##PYTHON
Has a compact syntax needing far fewer lines of code than languages like Java or C++. 
It’s very popular and is used for websites and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.

##R
A great language for doing statistics, and a popular choice in the scientific world.
